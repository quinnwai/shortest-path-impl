# Shortest Path Implementation
Implementing Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the shortest path within a graph in Java.

## Purpose
Make use of hash maps and a priority queue as a means to implement Dijkstra's algorithm. Used as lab work for a data structures and algoithms course.

## Overview
The most important function is the `run` function, which contains the set up and implementation of the algorithm

## Runtime
For all |V| where |V| is the number of vertices:
 - Sparse graph: &Theta;(|V|log|V|)
 - Dense graph: &Theta;(|V|<sup>2</sup>)
